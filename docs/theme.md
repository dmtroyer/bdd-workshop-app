When writing Behaviour Driven specs it is good to immerse yourself in the problems space
having realistic characters. As our example app is just a sample of a registration app we
had no clear characters to choose from. Instead we decied to choose the women in compute
science who created computer languages or were influential in developing languages. Here
is a brief about some of these characters, enjoy.
