## Multi layer BDD for modern rails web apps

Learn how to drive out functionality in a modern rails based web app with multi
layered, outside in Behaviour Driven Development, BDD. To scale tests for a
production scale app we will run you through the layers of testing that matter,
from "system flow" integration specs through "page mechanics" specs that take a
component through it's paces down through frontend component tests, API specs
through to specs to integrate to outside services and everything in between.
All the while building a fun app with Rails and ReactJS.

### Michael Milewski
Developer keen on the people side of things. I love pairing, I love coding with
people new to writing software and especially driving out software with tests.
I am about scaling development through the team and their practices. I love new
technology and the challenge of assimilating to how my pair wants to write code
and together we should be greater then just the sum of the parts.

### Selena Small
I am a full-stack software developer at Fresho! in Melbourne. Two and a half
years ago, I was running a restaurant, teaching myself to write code and
learning how to throw the perfect punch. Life is a balance of being active,
competitive and writing beautiful code
